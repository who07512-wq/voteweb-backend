/**
 * Deterministic test database setup.
 *
 * The integration suite must be self-contained: it must not depend on the
 * dev `seed.js` output (which creates passwordless STU-001..STU-005). This
 * module builds the exact fixtures the tests reference and is safe to run
 * repeatedly against a disposable test database:
 *
 *   - Deterministic auth fixtures  STU001 (STUDENT) / ADMIN001 (ADMIN) with
 *     the credentials the test file expects.
 *   - The base election structure the tests hardcode (election 1 = 'Student
 *     Council Election', club 1 'Techno Club', positions 1-3, candidates 1-6).
 *   - Cleanup of leftovers from interrupted runs (test-runner students).
 *
 * Deliberately scoped: only the known seed election and the fixture students
 * are (re)created. Nothing else in the database is touched.
